<h2>Bear!</h2>
<img src= "bear.JPG" style = "width:400px" alt = "Primary image of bear">

<p>
    Bear is a lazy, food-loving dog that is sometimes playful. His favorite activity is lying in the sun on his side and lounging. 
    He enjoys playing with his toys and loves to fetch them when you throw them, but eventually, he gets bored and just stops fetching them and lays down.
</p>
<p>
    Bear is also scared of a lot of things. He does not like water (showers and even rain) or getting his nails clipped, 
    and he is  sometimes even so lazy that he will just stop walking and sit down until you turn around and go back home.
